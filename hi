Create a traditional comic panel in ink-and-color style. The character is Donovan Wrath, a 20-year-old noble from a medieval city named Wrathopolis. He has long yellow hair, black skin tone, and blue eyes. In this scene, he is disguised in a rough servant’s robe and is sneaking through a stone corridor inside the rival Light family’s castle. His face looks tense and determined. He is on a secret mission to assassinate Caspian Light, the noble ruler of the city Lightopolis.

A thought bubble should say: "This is the only way to end the suffering of my people. I must kill Caspian Light."

The environment is dimly lit with flickering torches, creating a suspenseful and dramatic mood. The style should reflect classic Western comic book visuals — detailed shading, expressive features, and strong use of light and shadow.

The character is Donovan Wrath, a 20-year-old noble from a medieval city called Wrathopolis. He has a black skin tone, long flowing yellow hair, and striking blue eyes. He is currently disguised in a humble servant’s robe. In this scene, he is hiding behind a stone pillar inside the castle of his sworn enemy — the Light family — watching Caspian Light, the noble ruler of Lightopolis.

Caspian is shown in the distance, kindly helping a wounded soldier and offering food to a hungry child, demonstrating compassion and fairness.

Donovan looks shocked and confused, his expression reflecting inner conflict.

A whispered dialogue bubble from Donovan reads: "Why would he...?"

The mood is tense and conflicted, and the lighting is soft torchlight with shadows adding to the emotional weight of the moment.
Use the classic Western comic book style, with expressive faces and dramatic shading.

    The character is Donovan Wrath, a 20-year-old noble from a medieval city called Wrathopolis. He has a black skin tone, long yellow hair, and blue eyes. He is currently wearing a rough servant’s robe, but underneath it, he hides a royal emblem on his chest.

    In this scene, Donovan stands alone in a candlelit room inside Light Castle, looking into a tall mirror. One of his hands is gripping a dagger, while the other hand touches the royal emblem hidden beneath his robe. His reflection in the mirror shows his conflicted expression — his face shows doubt, regret, and internal struggle.

    A thought bubble says: "I was wrong. He is not the villain."

    The room has stone walls, warm candlelight, and shadows, emphasizing his emotional tension. The panel should evoke introspection and transformation, using classic Western comic book visuals with detailed facial expressions and dramatic lighting.

The character Donovan Wrath is now shown in his full royal attire: white armor with a black cape, long yellow hair, black skin tone, and blue eyes. He stands tall and proud inside a grand hall in Light Castle, having removed his earlier servant disguise.

In front of him stands Caspian Light, a nobleman from the rival city Lightopolis, dressed in elegant light-colored robes and wearing a calm, surprised expression. Caspian is slightly younger-looking, kind in demeanor.

Both men stand face to face in a moment of peace, not hostility.

Dialogue (Donovan): "I came to kill you… but found someone worthy of peace."
Dialogue (Caspian): "Then let this be the end of the feud."

The background shows tall windows with sunlight beaming in, symbolizing hope. The mood is hopeful, monumental, and historic.
Use classic Western comic book style, with detailed expressions, dramatic posture, and high contrast between dark and light tones.

The scene shows a bustling open market square where citizens of two rival medieval cities — Wrathopolis and Lightopolis — now gather peacefully together. People wear a mix of clothing: some in dark-toned Wrathopolis attire, others in light-colored Lightopolis robes, and many with blended outfits representing unity.

In the sky above, a black raven and a white dove fly side-by-side.

The market features stalls of art, books, food, and crafts. Children from both cities play together. Flags and banners show merged symbols of the two noble houses.

At the bottom of the panel is a narration box with the line:
“At night, Donovan sneaks in under shadows, but by dawn, he walks out into the light — and so does the future of his city.”

The atmosphere is bright and symbolic, full of peace, cultural fusion, and hope.
Use classic Western comic book style, with warm tones, vibrant crowd scenes, and soft sunlight filtering through the clouds.
